                    <h2>
                        <p class="sansserif">The reason why I chose this topic was to because I was always interested in optical illusions since I was a child and I wanted to research more about them, this project gave me the chance to do that. Also I have some problems with vision and studying the eye and some disorders allowed me to get a better understanding.</p></h2>
			<h1><p class="thick" class="monospace">OVERALL CONCLUSION:
</p></h1>
                <h2>
                    <p class="sansserif">Many people believe that optical illusions are a fun past time and cannot be counted as a science. However the study of the eyes and brain and how it reacts to different illusions can give lots of information about how the brain and eyes work together. However the eye and brain and their reaction to illusions has practical uses such as: psychology & perception and mental health.<BR>

<BR>Physiological illusions are typified by exposure to excessive stimuli such as bright lights or movement. These cause an imbalance in the viewer’s visual channels, resulting in altered observation. Physiological illusions such as The Hermann grid, take advantage of the theory that specific stimuli have already established neural channels from the participants early stages of visual processing. It is then the repetitive stimulation of one or two of these paths that causes the physiological disparity that adjusts the inspection and gives the affect of an illusion. Therefore experimenting with these illusions may not improve your optical vision but it will certainly exercise your mental perceptions.<BR>
     Our brains are compelled to perform this amalgamation and this ethos explains such illusions as the Kanizsa triangle which exploits the realms of individual’s depth perception. Frequently, our eyes and mind feel obligated to put what we see together and come to the conclusion we believe we are supposed to. In many 2D images, perspective is often alluded to through certain artistic techniques and mathematical rules, which combine to make the viewer see 3 dimensions present although there are obviously only 2. Again, these optical illusions are excellent for exercising the mind but unfortunately do very little for the  visual ability. Therefore we can conclude that although it is doubtful that gazing longingly at optical illusions will improve your actual vision, they can have a significant affect on the observer’s psychological capacities and consequently their perception.<BR></BR>
     Illusions have also been proven to improve mental health. In the 19th century, Dr. E. Babbit, M.D. proved that colored light was capable of healing through the effect on the autonomic nerve fibers in the skin and via the nerves from the eye to the brain. Dr. Spitler proved in the 1930’s that psychiatric illnesses could be cured or improved by using a visual colored light source. It is now known that there are at least four effects from light. These are:<BR><BR>

1. The optic nerve to the pituitary gland, temporal lobe, and occipital lobe of the brain. This information affects the conscious part of the brain without interpretation.<BR><BR> 

2. A second nerve bundle from the retina to the hypothalamus, which is a major control area for both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves. It has been shown that color affects neurotransmitter and hormone levels in the brain and spinal cord, which in turn affect the rest of metabolism and biochemistry.<BR><BR>

3. This path goes from the retina to the midbrain, and then to the superior cervical ganglion to the brainstem and then to the pineal gland. This area controls, among other things, our sleep cycle.<BR><BR>

4. The last is a direct effect of the light upon particles that travel in the lymph, blood, and nerves. Researchers at the University of Vienna found that albumin is one of the particles able to be charged by light. It is then able to deliver this charge to tissues at distant locations (tissues) in the body.<BR><BR>
The modern idea of self-regulation as a healing influence is based on the prescribed use of light and color to effect positive changes in the psychological or physical functioning of individuals. Humans need light of specific intensity and color range to regulate their biological states. The different light affects and controls human being and biological processes in the nature. Color has a profound effect on us on all levels physical, mental, emotional and spiritual. 
The health of a person is not only associated to how well his body functions but also to how well are his psychological and emotional states. The optical illusion images and visual effects can have a strong effect on emotional state and partially or entirely can changes the psychological or physical functioning of individuals by Self-Regulation.  Our brain is looking for ways to maintain or restore a balanced state. Suitable optical illusion images and visual effects for you is the one you need at this moment. When people look at suitable optical illusion images, it is providing self-regulation by using their own mechanisms of the health support.</p>
